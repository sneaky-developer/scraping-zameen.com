# scraping-zameen.com
Title, Location, Price, Agency, Agent, MobileNumber, PhoneNumber, all are extracted from the zameen.com website of a particular category

I selected the lahore category, then just set up the link and in for loop just told scraper to scrap how many pages from particular category.

Scraper goes on each page and each property card present on page, it would also skip the advertisement cards present on the page.

Opening each property through link and then reading the title, price, location, agency, agent.

Then pressing the "CALL" button present on the page of individual property, then a screep pops out and displying the name and mobile number and phone number.
I extreacted the mobile number and phone number and then extracted the name from that page to just cross verify(this name coloun is presnt in the right most side of list)

All of the exceptions are handeled in the code very well and crosed verified it as well.
